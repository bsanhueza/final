Benjamin Sanhueza's KIEI MVP Project
Pickup Soccer Miami

When I lived in Miami, me and my friends had a soccer social club. We played at least once a week and then did an after game BBQ party.
Each game had a BBQ leader, who bought everything for that day.
The game planning was made via Whatsapp, which had some flaws in terms of tidyness and structure.

Pickup Soccer Miami allows players to sign up/create games/browse games/RSVP for games/RSVP for BBQ/check attendance/get notified on their phones.
